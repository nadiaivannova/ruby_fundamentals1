#You decide to get some exercise and fresh air, but you want to keep track of how far from home you are.

#Ask the user for input on what action to take - walk or run. If they walk, the total distance should go up by one, and you should update the user on their total distance traveled as follows:

#{}"Distance from home is 6 km."

#If they run, their total distance should go up by 5. Your program should keep asking for input - you don't know where you're going until you get there! Each time, you should print the total distance traveled.
